A C# port of ROM 2.4b6

Background
==========
In my younger days, before the graphical splendor of MMORPGs like Anarchy Online (my first,) Final Fantasy XI and World of Warcraft, I wasted many, many nights on a couple different ROM-based MUDs. Even after MMOs began taking off, something about the old text-based MUDs held a special place in my heart, especially ROM as after playing them for a few years, I transitioned to spending many a night messing around with the source code, figuring out at least the very basics of C to be able to make minor modifications and bug fixes to a perpetually-under-construction MUD of my own.

Because ROM holds such a special place in my heart, and my professional life has led me to favor C# over most other languages, I've decided to do a C# port of the ROM server, because why not?

v1.0 Goals
=====
1. Telnet support
2. Feature parity with ROM 2.4b4
3. Compatibility with ROm 2.4b4 file formats and structure

v2.0 Goals
==========
1. SSH support (again, because why not?)
2. Modern data storage engine (relational DB? NOSQL?)
3. Simple NPC dialogue trees

vFuture Goals
=============
1. Scripted mobs (complex dialogue trees, triggered actions, etc.)
2. >200 concurrent user capacity on commodity hardware (aka my Core i5-2500K w/16GB RAM)

Closing
=======
Yes, I know no one is ever going to use this software, if I even finish it, but it's something to keep me occupied and takes me out of my comfort zone (I'm an ASP.NET/C# web developer by trade who's only dabbled in console apps before, and never built a serious standalone server app before).
